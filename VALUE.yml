# version: protocol version, must appear only at the root
# description: optinal description, can appear at any node
# split  - splits value to child nodes according to their shares ratio
# shares - number of shares for a node (used to calculate shares ratio amongst sibling nodes)
# crypto - pay value to the node directly to a crypto currency address
# passcard - pay value to the node directly to one of the addresses specified in the passcard (may later turn this into url)
# namecoin - pay value according to instructions defined in this namecoin record. if record does not exist then hold the funds for later distribution.
# url - pay value according to instructions defined in this url. if url returns 404 or other error then hold the funds for later distribution.

# Nodes are defined in a list, prefixed by '-'. The node name must not be a keyword
# Each node must contain a nested 'shares' and may contain one of 'crypto','url','passcard'

# How relative value is calculated: each node's value ratio is calculated according to the shares of all the nodes at the same depth (siblings)
